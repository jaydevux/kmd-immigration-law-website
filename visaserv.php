        	 <p>Visas is a document that gives the holder permission to  enter the United States  on either a temporary or permanent basis. Visas are broken down in various  categories based on the rights granted the holder of the visa and each category  is represented by a letter.  </p>
<p>Choosing which category is right for you and the application  process can be daunting that is why it is best to have legal  representation.  The Law Offices of  Kenneth M. Diesenhof can assist you with the selection of appropriate visa  category for you and the application process.</p>
