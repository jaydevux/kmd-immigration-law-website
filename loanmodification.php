        <p>If you are currently underwater with your mortgage and in fear of losing your home to foreclosure this office is very excited to share a software program that was designed for you.   </p>
<p>EZModification is an on line mortgage modification software which we can say with confidence has NO real competition.</p><br/>
 <p>
 It has taken us over 3 years in the making to create this software. EZModification is a software that is considered the “Turbo Tax” of the mortgage industry. EZModification was exclusively sold to attorneys over the past few years.  We have over 450 banks and growing built into it and have all their guidelines. Our software has the H.A.M.P (Home Affordable Modification Program) guidelines built into it (2% fixed for 5 years, increases 1% year 6 and another 1% year 7, then fixed at  4 or 4 ½% for the life of the loan).We also have the Treasury’s guidelines built into it as well as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. </p><br/>
 <p>
 The software is smart enough to decide for the customer which program to put them into and will always choose the lesser payment.  We update the banks guidelines as often as daily or as often as they change. With our program you cannot “Negotiate” rates as attorneys will have you believe. You either fit in to a program or not NO ONE can negotiate a restructuring of their loan, you either fit in the program or not.</p><br/>
 <p>Today 1 in 3 Americans needs this program and other businesses out there have a 5-15% success rate. We have a 96.8% success rate and also offer a 100% money back guarantee to back up those statistics. Our back office is very diligent and knows how to be persistent with the banks to get the customers approved. </p>
