			<h2>Children born overseas out of wedlock </h2>  
			<p> Children born abroad after December 24, 1952 to unmarried American mothers are U.S. citizens, as long as the mother has lived in the U.S. for a continuous period of at least one year at any time prior to the birth.
</p><p>Children born to American fathers unmarried to the children's non-American mothers are considered U.S. citizens only if the father meets the "physical presence" conditions described above, and the father takes several actions:
</p>
            <ul><li>•	Unless deceased, has agreed to provide financial support to the child until he reaches 18,</li>
<li>•	Establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence and, while the person is under the age of 18 years </li>
<ul><li>o	the person is legitimated under the law of the person’s residence or domicile,</li>
<li>o	the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or</li>
<li>o	the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court. </li></ul></ul>
<p>	U.S.C. § 1409 paragraph (a) provides that acknowledgment of paternity can be shown by acknowledging paternity under oath and in writing; having the issue adjudicated by a court; or having the child otherwise "legitimated" by law.</p>
