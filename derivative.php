			<h2>Derivative Citizenship Applications</h2>
			<p> Recent changes in the law have made it easier for people who have been born outside of the United States where at least one of their parents is a United States Citizen to claim United States Citizenship.  If you have at least one parent who is a United States Citizen by birth or became one before you became eighteen may be entitled to United States Citizenship.  Please contact our office for more details.</p>
