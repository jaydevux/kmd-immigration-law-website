Naturalization</h2>      <br />      

 <p>If you are lawful permanent resident (Green
Card Holder) your next logical step will be naturalization.  However, many Green
Card Holder worry that if they travel abroad for extensive periods of time they
will not be able acquire enough time inside the U.S.A. to qualify for
naturalization.   The simple answer this situation is to file out and file the
U.S.C.I.S. N-470 Application to Preserve Residence for Naturalization.  This
allows a Green Card Holder to travel abroad and preserves your residence for the
purposes of Naturalization.</p> <br />

<p>Why is preserving residence in the U.S.A. some
important for Green Card Holders who want to Naturalize.  The simple answer is
when you fill out your application for Naturalization you must prove that half
of the preceding three or five years in which you had a Green Card were spent in
the U.S.A..  If can not establish that then you can not naturalize.</p> <br />

<p> How does the N-470 work?  This is how, John is a Green Card Holder who travels abroad to
the Philippines on business for a month long period several times a year.  He
files his N-470 then the time spent in the Philippines.  As grounds for filing
the N-470 he states he does work for an American Company with clients in the
Philippines.  Based on this this time will not be deducted from his time in the
U.S.A. and he can still file for Naturalization as soon as reaches the
milestone.</p> <br />

<p> This is just one way residence can be preserved for purposes of
Naturalization.  For more information about this or any other subject please
contact the Law Offices of Kenneth M. Diesenhof.</p> <br />
