<h1>Get your Visa by investing in the US</h1>
<h2>Investment money is always welcome in the U.S.A.</h2>
<br/>
<p>The United States has been called the land of opportunity and that means we like people who make the U.S.A. money.  This usually takes the form of taxes for the Federal, State, and Local Governments and jobs for U.S. Citizens.  </p><br/>

<p>So if you got the money to invest Uncle Sam wants you.</p><br/>
<p>There are three visas that an investor can use to come to the U.S.A. and work they are the E-1, E-2 and EB-5.  </p><br/>

<p>The E-Visas (E-1 and E-2) are available to any one who is a citizen of any country that has a treaty of friendship and commerce with the U.S.A.</p><br/>

<p>There are two types of E-Visa:</p><br/>

<p><b><a href="InvestmentE1.php"><h2>E-1 Treaty Trader</h2></a></b></p><br/>
<p>This visa is for anyone who wishes to open or buy a business that is involved with substantial trade with the country that he/she came from.</p><br/>

<p> <b><a href="InvestmentE2.php"><h2>E-2 Treaty Investor</h2></a></b></p><br/>
  
<p>This visa is for anyone who wishes to open or buy a bona fide business in the U.S.A..  Where the investor has invested a substantial amount of capital and is taking an active role in the operation of the business.  </p>
